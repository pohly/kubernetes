// For example, it ensures that logging is set up properly. Logging
// flags get added to the command line if not added already. Flags get normalized
// so that help texts show them with hyphens. Underscores are accepted
// as alternative for the command parameters.
//
// Run tries to be smart about how to print errors that are returned by the
// command: before logging is known to be set up, it prints them as plain text
// to stderr. This covers command line flag parse errors and unknown commands.
// Afterwards it logs them. This covers runtime errors.

// should use RunNoErrOutput instead and deal with the returned error themselves.

		// is less readable. Using klog.Fatal is even worse because it
		// dumps a stack trace that isn't about the error.
		//
		// But if it is some other error encountered at runtime, then
		// we want to log it as error, at least in most commands because
		// their output is a log event stream.
		//
		// We can distinguish these two cases depending on whether
		// we got to logs.InitLogs() above.
		//
		// This heuristic might be problematic for command line
		// tools like kubectl where the output is carefully controlled
		// and not a log by default. They should use RunNoErrOutput
		// instead.
		//
		// The usage of klog is problematic also because we don't know
		// whether the command has managed to configure it. This cannot

		// https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3078
